# Tik-Tool
Tools specifically designed for WISPs to quickly configure MikroTik devices

# Requirements
Windows OS
python 3.7 or greater
fplib, PyQt5 python modules

Make sure that the tik_tool_rc.py file is in the same directory as the Tik Tool Public.py file.

# Setup
The Mikrotik device needs to be reachable via 192.168.88.1 with the default user and no password (to start out)

# Customize
Change line #482 to the password that you want the device to have
Change line #483 to the ROMON seceret that you want the device to have

Currently there is only a config for the RB2011, I will be adding other devices and configs later.

This tool was built with my WISP preferences in mind, feel free to change it to how you would like it.

If you would like for me to customize this tool for you, reach out to me and we can see if we can come to some sort of an agreement.
